            question:
                "Why should I choose Mennr over other agencies / competitors?",
            answer: `Apart from the multiple benefits already highlighted in the "Why Mennr" section, one primary reason that businesses choose to partner with Mennr is our obsessive focus on always keeping our client's needs and wants as our number one priority. If you are not getting the results that you have paid for, why are we even in the picture? We grow when you grow, so we make sure your growth is always on the rise and we consistently deliver on what what we have promised. `,

            question:
                "How many people from the Mennr team will work on my business if I partner with Mennr? ",
            answer: "Depending on a partners requirements, chances are that there will be multiple teams working on your project to ensure we deliver on our promises. Something that Mennr is proud of, is their strong in-house teams spanning across various marketing and web development verticals. All of Mennr's teams are in-house and are segmented across multiple different specialisations. Having teams focused on various specialisations helps Mennr ensure that their partners recieve a quality service in terms of both performance and companionship.",
        },
        {
            question: "What is the role of a dedicated relationship manager?",
            answer: "Every business that partners with Mennr is assigned a dedicated relationship manager, who is also a marketing strategist, that they can contact at any time. This relationship manager meets with partners weekly or monthly and is responsible for ensuring that partners are keep up to date on all of the marketing, advertising, content creation, reviews management, listings management, and web design that Mennr does for them. Mennr's relationship managers are also responsible for making sure that you understand everything that our team is doing, why we are doing it, and what to expect. They're how Mennr maintains transparency with their partners, ensuring that every partner recieves a solution that adapts to their businesses needs and situations.",

            question:
                "I don't want / have a lot of money to spend on digital marketing. Can I still partner with Mennr?",
            answer: "If done right, a business do not need to spend thousands of dollars to see the results that their businesses needs to grow. Before you pay us anything, we build a customized plan as per your business requirments and give you a step-by-step plan and a final quote and let you give us your input. While we do not have a minimum budget, the prices for our services vary as per client requirements. Mennr tries to offer pocket-friendly services by cutting our profit margins as low as we can. But, we have to keep the lights on and food on the table too. As a result not all businesses are a fit for our solutions. To those businesses, we recommend a free training course on how to carry out basic SEO, Google Business Profile optimization, and Google Ads to get them started in the right direction.",

            question:
                "I want to increase my business through digital marketing but I don't know what will work best for my business. How can Mennr help?",
            answer: "You are not alone. Most local businesses that we partner with are unaware of the multiple ways that they can get more customers online and grow their digital presence. Digital marketing is a vast vertical and can be tricky. That is where we come in. Our expert teams will sit with your team to understand what you want and give you a personalized step-by-step plan to help you achieve your business and marketing goals. This will be given to you absolutely free. Once you undertsand what you need, you can choose to partner with us or take a alternative route that may seem better for you. No strings attached.",

            question:
                "Can I just opt for your free marketing audit for my current digital presence even if I later choose not to partner with Mennr? ",
            answer: "Yes, you can. Our free audit is a guide for us and our client to understand where their business and marketing efforts may be lacking and come up with a growth plan for them. We love our job. Conducting marketing and business audits for clients is a fun first step before partnering with them. This step is absolutely free but gives both Mennr and our clients absolute clarity on what kind of results can be expected down the road. We understand that not every client that we present our plan to will opt to partner with us for a number of reasons. However, our free marketing audit will paint a clear picture of the kind of results they can expect working with Mennr. ",

                "If I partner with Mennr, how will I know where my money is being spent?",
            answer: `With one of our most beloved partner feature, our "Partner Dashboard". All of our clients get access to an easy-to-understand partner dashboard. With the partner dashboard, you can log in at any time and review important performance data such as: the channels your money is being spent on and how these channels are performing through key KPIs such as website traffic, conversions, etc. The partner dashboard will allow you to compare actual performance metrics to projections and offers compelete transparency to all of our clients.

These timelines are completely different for each service we offer and also different for each business we partner with.
