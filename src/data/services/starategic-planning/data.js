This includes understanding the business's strengths and weaknesses, assessing competitors, reviewing budget, resources, and identifying potential challenges and opportunities to set realistic objectives that help reach those goals. When making a strategic plan, you as a business owner should take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Remember it’s not just about setting goals, but also mapping out the path to reaching those goals which may involve creative approaches and thinking outside of the box. ",

Then start to think what your business needs to do in order to reach that goal from where your business current is positioned. Jot these down on a note pad as you brainstorm","Conduct a SWOT analysis of you business to assess the internal and external factors that impact how you reach your goal","After getting a picture of your landscape and goal, you can start setting objectives for you and your team to work towards. These should be what are called SMART goals. These goals (or objectives) are what needs to be completed in order to reach the long term goal you set at the start. This can be things like servicing x amount of customers or getting x amount of people to visit your website. The trick is to make sure that the objectives you are setting are specific, measurable, and relevant to the over long term goal you have set. Jot these goals down on a notepad or in a management tool like Asana","Work with your staff to develop strategies to help achieving the SMART goals (objectives). This is where thinking outside of the box comes into play to develop strategies that utilize your competitive strengths and market opportunities. Then breakdown each strategy into actionable steps, assign a member of your staff to be responsible for it, and set timelines each objective. We recommend you create a document at this point or use a project management tool like Asana to keep yourself organized","As your staff begins to execute your strategic plan, completing their objectives, you need to monitor their performance and execution. To do this you can create what are called key performance indicators which you can then use to measure how they are performing in relation to where you expect them to be. When you notice a staff member not meeting your KPIs, have a discussion to understand what’s gone wrong. If needed adjust the KPIs, assign them to a different objective, or provide them with some addition training and guidance ","Continue to keep a clear line of communication with your staff. Make changes to your strategic plan as needed and repeat these steps to create a strategic plan for another long term business objective"],
