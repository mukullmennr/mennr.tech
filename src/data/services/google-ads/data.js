Since we are running a search ad let’s consider what product or service we want to focus our advertising on, then build out our ads headlines and description around that. For this example we’ll choose to advertise our seasonal depression therapy sessions. Our goal is to get people to click the ad who are experiencing seasonal depression and want someone to talk to. Therefore we build out content that let’s people searching know we understand what they’re going through and can help","Based on what the focus of our advertisement is (getting people with seasonal depression to book a session with us), we’ll brainstorm what people might be searching who are looking for our services. We settle on targeting keywords and phrases like “how to cope with seasonal depression” and “therapy for seasonal depression”","Now we can set the location we want our ads to target. For our case we will be targeting the zip codes that are bordering the town our office is in. We decided our locations to target based on the average age of the population in these towns, their occupations, and their distance from our office.

Don’t expect stellar results on your first go, but make sure to monitor the campaigns performance daily. Take this first month as an opportunity to test a few different images, keywords, locations, content, etc. During this month you’ll be able to work hands on with what is called ‘optimizing’ a campaign.
