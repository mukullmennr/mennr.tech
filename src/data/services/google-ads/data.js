These Google Ads appear when a potential customer makes a search relevant to the keywords you target and bid on in your campaign. Alternatively there are Display Ads which appear in before the customer starts searching for your businesses products or services. Display Ads enable you to appear in front of your target audience prior to them searching for your businesses products or services in places that make sense. ",

This is where someone who clicks your ad will be redirect to","Then you will need to select your main advertising goal. For Search Ads we will select ‘Get more website sales’. Alternatively we could have selected ‘Get more calls’ if we wanted people to call us directly instead of going through our website","Next you can select what specific type of campaign you want to run. This is where we are able to choose ‘Search’ as our campaign type so that our ad can appear when people are searching on Google. Alternatively we could have selected Performance Max if we wanted to get foot traffic to our store with ads through Google Maps","After selecting our campaign type, we can now create the content for our ad. Since we are running a search ad let’s consider what product or service we want to focus our advertising on, then build out our ads headlines and description around that. For this example we’ll choose to advertise our seasonal depression therapy sessions. Our goal is to get people to click the ad who are experiencing seasonal depression and want someone to talk to. Therefore we build out content that let’s people searching know we understand what they’re going through and can help","Based on what the focus of our advertisement is (getting people with seasonal depression to book a session with us), we’ll brainstorm what people might be searching who are looking for our services. We settle on targeting keywords and phrases like “how to cope with seasonal depression” and “therapy for seasonal depression”","Now we can set the location we want our ads to target. For our case we will be targeting the zip codes that are bordering the town our office is in. We decided our locations to target based on the average age of the population in these towns, their occupations, and their distance from our office.

Either drive people to your website, drive people towards calling you, or drive people towards visiting your business in person. To achieve this, you’re best to set your campaign goal as either sales, leads, website traffic, or awareness. Apart from campaign goals, there are various campaign types to choose from depending on your business. Typically as a small business you will be choosing between Performance Max, Search, Display, Discovery, and Shopping campaigns." },
			{ head: "Be Realistic With What You Can Spend", text: "Before you actually see results from your Google Ads campaigns, setting aside a budget of $500 or more can be a bit daunting. What we recommend is that you first set aside a few hundred dollars (that you can afford to lose) to run your first campaign. Don’t expect stellar results on your first go, but make sure to monitor the campaigns performance daily. Take this first month as an opportunity to test a few different images, keywords, locations, content, etc. During this month you’ll be able to work hands on with what is called ‘optimizing’ a campaign. At the end of the month asses how it went, and then decide how you want to approach budgeting for the following months once you have a better understanding of how to run a campaign that produces a return on ad spend (ROAS).

			{ head: "Keep Track of How Your Customers Interact With Your Ads", text: "When you publish the first version of a new campaign, it is still rough around the edges. The fine edge work is done by setting up what is called ‘conversion tracking’. Conversion tracking is what allows you to see whenever someone visits your website, gets directions to your business, or calls your business through your ad. Additionally is consistently reviewing what is called a ‘search terms’ report. This is what you can use to see how often people are search for keywords and phrases that you are targeting within your targeted location. To get a quick assessment of the quality of your ad, always be sure to check your Quality Score which is a rating Google gives your ad based in short on relevancy." },
			{ head: "Target Specific Keywords and Phrases, Not Broad Ones", text: "Using Googles Keyword Planner is a great way to avoid this, but still some people get this confused. To avoid targeting broad keywords that are dominated by businesses with infinite cash, you need to make build campaign that advertise a specific product or service you offer. Let’s say you are an automotive services business. Instead of creating a campaign with the goal of bringing in all type of auto repair business, the business should create a campaign targeting people who are looking for oil changes. By being specific with what product or service you want to advertise, you naturally should be able to avoid using broad keywords or phases. If your listing keywords to target and you notice they are broad, rethink what exactly you want to advertise to be more specific." },

By selecting Performance Max, Search, Display, Discovery, or Shopping as your campaign type, you can influence where your ad will be displayed. Let’s say you are a new retail store opening up in a thriving suburb. You want to let people know that your store is having a grand opening event at the start of next month. To raise awareness you would want to create a Display ad campaign so that your ad can reach people who might be interested while they search the web. Or maybe you are a restaurant in a city with loads of tourists. You want to attract people driving into the city for dinner so you run a Performance Max campaign running ads on Google Maps so your restaurant is the first thing they see when searching through maps. Where your ad is displayed plays a huge factor in the success of your campaign so be sure to really think about where and how your customers would be searching for a product or service you offer.

			{ head: "Have a Clean & Easily Navigable Website", text: "A clean website is sort of like the frosting on the cake. You baked the cake by creating your first campaign and setting your goals. But just like a cake, those ads can have little effectiveness if the place you are sending interested customers looks like it should have virtual cobwebs. Five years ago you could get away with having a poorly constructed website. But now consumers expect a bit more out of businesses with 75% of consumers judging the quality of a business based on the businesses website. When someone clicks your ad and goes to your website, you want them to be able to effortlessly find themselves making the action you intended for them to take when visiting your site. Don’t use weird colors, don’t be a car salesmen with the content on your website, include real images of your business, and have a friend navigate the website to see how difficult it is for them. Make corrections where needed. Do that and you should have yourself a website that’s good enough to convert visitors from your ads into customers." },
