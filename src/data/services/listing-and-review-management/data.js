While a few extra positive 5 star reviews can help you beat out competition, just one negative 1 star review can leave a stain on your business if it’s not handled correctly. And by handled correctly, we mean by responding to the review. Nowadays virtually all reviews websites give businesses the ability to respond to all reviews for this very reason. When someone give your business a negative review, read their review and try to identify what went wrong. Then respond to that review being apologetic and offering a solution if applicable. But if you believe this review to be falsified for malicious intent you can get in contact with the platform the review is displayed on to have it removed.  Below we will cover good versus bad Reviews Management, best practices, and will close out with a guide to responding to Google reviews your business may already have.",

The objective isn’t to mindlessly respond to reviews though. A major part of the reviews management process is being able to keep track of all the different platforms your customers are leaving reviews on, and being able to see when new reviews are coming in on those platforms. Once you can track those reviews it’s important to keep an eye on what people are leaving reviews on and adapt if needed. Sometimes a review could be in reference to a specific employee, how clean something was, or the quality of service, metrics you as a business should want to monitor.",

As you read reviews, note down what customers are saying they like and dislike. Place a tally mark next to common likes and dislikes as you see them.
