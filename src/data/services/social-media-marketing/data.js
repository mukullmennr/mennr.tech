Social Media Management enables business to maintain consistency and personality when creating posts, leaving likes, and comments. In short, you can think of Social Media Management as the digital voice that builds brand recognition. Without it, you have a brand that doesn’t interact with it’s customers resulting in no word of mouth referrals and no one recognizing your business when you run ads.

Consistent engagements doesn’t mean  just creating a posting schedule and clever content. In addition to those, your brand should also be leaving comments, giving likes, posting stories, and engaging in local community groups. On social media don’t think of your brand as a business. Think of it like it is a member of the community. You aren’t there to sell, you are there to interact just like how you would if it was your personal account. As a small business owner, we recommend owners login to their business’s profile on their phones, and instead of using social media for your personal account during the day, use your businesses social media accounts so you can maintain a consistent community involvement. Eventually, you’ll become a known and recognized name around the community just from your consistent social media interactions.",

This tells you what type of content your audience likes. Fom there it’s on you to then create content that follows a similar style, yet is completely unique to you. Let’s say a competitor posts a really nice looking ad on their Facebook page promoting a holiday sale. Instead of copying their ad style and the caption they wrote, take some time to see what part of the ad caught your attention, Take that piece and then build off of that to create your content. Using our Mennr website as an example, the layout of our website and pages are built as a result of inspiration we got from various websites. Yet the content within our website is all hand written based on knowledge and research. Another important thing to mention here is AI generated content. Please, please, please, do not use AI generated content for your social media posts, captions, or comments. To put it simply, AI generated content is bland, it lacks your personality, and is very noticeable when used . If we can write the content for this website and all of our partners sites without AI, you can create captions and leave comments without it too. " },
