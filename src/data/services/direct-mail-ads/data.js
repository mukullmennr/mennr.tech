		text: "Direct Mail Ads are a way for businesses to send physical mail to potential customers through the United States Postal Service. This involves sending promotional material such as brochures, catalogs, or letters directly to potential customers’ homes or offices. The key characteristic of direct mail advertising is its personal and targeted approach. Businesses can tailor their mailing lists to reach specific demographics, geographical areas, or even specific customers, making it a great addition to any localized digital marketing campaign. Unlike digital ads that can be quickly scrolled past, direct mail is tangible making it something that potential customers can return to later. Also, not everyone is receptive to digital marketing making it an important piece to reaching customers who aren’t online. Even though digital marketing tactics are getting more effective everyday, direct mail ads are a surviving form of traditional marketing that can still add value to small businesses.",

To entice people to come in for new tires, the repair shop mentions on the flyer to bring it in for 10% your next set of tires. The tire shop creates the flyers design making sure it is not cluttered and is easily readable. They print the flyers, bring them to the post office, and ask for them to sent to everyone in town. The flyers are sent out and almost immediately the shop see people coming in for tires with the flyer in hand.",
