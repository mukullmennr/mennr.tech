Social Media Management enables business to maintain consistency and personality when creating posts, leaving likes, and comments. In short, you can think of Social Media Management as the digital voice that builds brand recognition.

Consistent engagements doesn’t mean  just creating a posting schedule and clever content. In addition to those, your brand should also be leaving comments, giving likes, posting stories, and engaging in local community groups. On social media don’t think of your brand as a business. Think of it like it is a member of the community. You aren’t there to sell, you are there to interact just like how you would if it was your personal account. As a small business owner, we recommend owners login to their business’s profile on their phones, and instead of using social media for your personal account during the day, use your businesses social media accounts so you can maintain a consistent community involvement. Eventually, you’ll become a known and recognized name around the community just from your consistent social media interactions.",

When you’re leaving comment on your previous customers Instagram posts or engaging in conversation on local Facebook groups, it’s important to just talk normally. Don’t try to turn something into a sale when your commenting. Remember, the objective is interact with people on social media so your business name and logo are seen in places where people within your community hangout online, like local Facebook groups." },
			{ head: "Be Realistic With What You Can Spend", text: "When creating posts and captions for those posts it’s important to look at businesses similar to yours to see what works for them. This tells you what type of content your audience likes. Fom there it’s on you to then create content that follows a similar style, yet is completely unique to you. Let’s say a competitor posts a really nice looking ad on their Facebook page promoting a holiday sale. Instead of copying their ad style and the caption they wrote, take some time to see what part of the ad caught your attention, Take that piece and then build off of that to create your content. Using our Mennr website as an example, the layout of our website and pages are built as a result of inspiration we got from various websites. Yet the content within our website is all hand written based on knowledge and research. Another important thing to mention here is AI generated content. Please, please, please, do not use AI generated content for your social media posts, captions, or comments. To put it simply, AI generated content is bland, it lacks your personality, and is very noticeable when used . If we can write the content for this website and all of our partners sites without AI, you can create captions and leave comments without it too. " },

First of which is to maintain an active brand presence so people can see you have a running business when they visit your socials. Second is for Facebook and Instagram. The way to get growth on social platforms is to create content that the platforms can then recommend to other users. But apart from what content you are actually creating, Facebook and Instagram also want to see that you are actively posting new content that they can continue to recommend to other users. Social platforms make money through the content users post, so they’ll promote your profile for free to other users as long as they think other users will be interested in it." },
