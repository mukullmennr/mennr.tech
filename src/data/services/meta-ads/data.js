We find that Meta Ads take a bit more effort to get right when compared to Google Ads, but still can be valuable when used by businesses to target people who have already viewed their website. Technically you can optimize that grouping further, but to not over complicate things we’ll leave it at that generalization. Yes, there’s billions of people using Facebook and Instagram daily. But it’s important to realize that Meta Ads are best used to re-engage with people who have already shown interest in your products or services in the past. It's not just about reaching a vast audience; it's about reaching the right people with the right message at the right time. Below we'll dive into what Meta Ads are, the difference between well-executed and poorly executed Meta Ads campaigns, Meta Ads best practices, and a step-by-step guide to get you started running your first campaign.",

This is different from your more general Google Ads which are better for first interactions with new business. Meta Ads are for that second interaction which you hope leads to the prospect visiting your website, booking a meeting, or giving you a phone call. As a result, when you run Meta Ads you should expect to see higher engagement rates leading to better conversion on your campaigns if executed correctly.  ",
