	text: "For small local businesses, Reputation Management is what larger corporate companies would call PR. You want the public to perceive your business in a specific way. Someone in the trades might want the public perception of their brand to be the most skilled in their craft. Or a restaurant might want to be known as the go-to place for dinner. To build up this reputation in the community, you need to manage not only your reviews but also what awards and certifications your business has, quality of the product or service you business provides, how people view your business online, and how people talk about your business in person. A properly crafted reputation gives your business recognition and creditability before you make first contact with customers. Below we will look over what exactly Reputation Management is, good and bad execution of it, best practice your small business should follow, and we will end off with a guide on how you can start managing your businesses reputation.",

		text: "Reputation Management is how a business goes about managing the public perception of their brand. This is done through a variety of means on both online and offline fronts. Online Reputation Management for small businesses involves the content you produce on your website and social media, the reviews people leave for your brand, and where you appear when people search for your business on search engines. Offline Reputation Management involves things like the content you put on print ads, local news station appearances, appearances at local home shows and festivals, how your employees interact with customers, the quality of your product or service, and your businesses overall engagement with the community (do you sponsor local sports teams, are you on the board, etc.). The objective is to build and maintain a positive reputation within your community through various channels. Not only does it make all of your marketing efforts perform better by added recognition and creditability, it’s a nice feeling when someone recognizes your logo and says they heard great things about you.",
