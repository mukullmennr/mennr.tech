		text: "Business listings are public profiles that contain information about businesses, such as their name, address, phone number, hours of operation, and types of products or services offered. These listings are typically displayed on various online platforms, including search engines like Google and Bing, social media sites, local business directories, and review sites such as Yelp and Angi. The primary purpose of business listings is to make businesses easily discoverable and accessible to potential customers. Listings also play a part in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for local small businesses, by telling search engines that your business is creditable and can be trusted over lacking competitors. You can think of business listings as the modern day phone book. Just like the phone book, you wouldn’t want to display the wrong phone number or address of your business there. That’s why maintaining accuracy and comprehensiveness of business listings are crucial for establishing credibility and trust with customers, with search engines, and in getting new customers to your business.",
