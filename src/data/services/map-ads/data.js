Now, by creating normal Performance Max campaign you can set a specific conversion goal for bringing foot traffic into your business. And what’s something people out and about are always using? An app on your phone for navigation. Google obviously knows this too, so when you set store visits as a campaign goal Google puts you in front of people searching on Google Maps or even Waze (Waze will be coming to Google Ads sometime next year, no confirmed release date is public).",

Click ‘Edit Profile’, and make sure you have accurately filled out all of the information under the ‘About’, ‘Contact’, ‘Location’, and ‘Hours’ tabs. Under ‘More’ you will see more options which can be added if they’re applicable to your business","Search for Google Ads and sign in or create an account being sure to use the same email address as you used to create your GBP. Click the 'Create' button and select 'Campaign.' Choose 'Local store visit and promotions' as your campaign goal and select 'Performance Max' as the campaign type.","You'll then confirm your conversion goals, which could be store visits, contacts, or directions. Add your business location, give your campaign a name, and click ‘Continue’","Now you can set how you want to spend you ads budget in bidding preferences. In the bidding section, choose a bid strategy, either focusing on conversions or conversion value. If you want to target new customers specifically, there's an option for that too","Navigate to campaign settings, select the locations (zip, city, state, radius) you want to target as well as the languages your customers speak","At this point you’re ready to setup your asset group by giving it a name and adding your images, logos, videos, headlines, descriptions, and calls to action to the campaign. Additionally you can further optimize your campaign with audience signals but we won’t be covering that here","The next step is to set your average daily budget, being sure to look at how that translates to projected ad spend for the month. Ironically yes, you setup how you want to spend your budget before actually setting your budget ","Finally you can review your entire campaign and click ‘Publish Campaign’. From there, monitor the ads performance daily adjusting the locations targeted, daily spending, and keywords targeted as needed. At this point you may be confused as to how you will show up in Google Maps through navigational search. Well, Google looks at your business and how you setup your campaign to deliver your ad in places where it makes the most sense for them to be. For example, when you selected ‘Local store visit and promotion’ as your goal and ‘Performance Max’ as your campaign type, that combined with your Google Business Profile, tells Google exactly where your ads need to go in order to reach your target"],

You can target anything from specific zip codes, cities, states, regions, or utilize the basic radius targeting where you can reach any area within a specific radius of your business. Geo-location targeting is best utilized by first determining where your potential customers live, then by analyzing your competitors presence in the area, and finally assessing how relevant your ads would be to the targeted locations given seasonal changes.

			{ head: "Ask For Reviews and Respond to Everyone", text: "Getting reviews from your customers is important for 2 main reasons. First, this is a simple way to gain creditability. Second, it shows Google you’re business is better liked in comparison to your competitors. The best way to get reviews is simply by asking your customers to leave a review to help your business grow. But getting reviews is only half of it. Responding to these reviews is important too. For Google, responding to reviews tells them your business is actively engaging with customers. For your customers, this is a chance for them to see both sides of a review. A poor review can hurt a business, but if you respond to that poor review in a positive manner, that response can negate the negative impact of that review in the eyes of the customer. " },

In Google Ads Manager, you can look at a report of how your ads are performing daily, weekly, or monthly. Let’s say you start off running map ads every day of the week 24/7. You see people are interacting with your ad during the week days, but that interaction is not turning into new business. But, on weekends you see that your map ads are getting lots of reach, and in turn you are getting lots of new business on the weekends. A change you might want to make your campaign then would be to only set your ads to run over the weekend. This saves you money on ad spend, while not missing out on the weekend business. Now this is a very basic example, but should give you the right idea. " },
