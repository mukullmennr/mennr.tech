	text: "As we all know reviews can make or break a small business. While a few extra positive 5 star reviews can help you beat out competition, just one negative 1 star review can leave a stain on your business if it’s not handled correctly. And by handled correctly, we mean by responding to the review. Nowadays virtually all reviews websites give businesses the ability to respond to all reviews for this very reason. When someone give your business a negative review, read their review and try to identify what went wrong. Then respond to that review being apologetic and offering a solution if applicable. But if you believe this review to be falsified for malicious intent you can get in contact with the platform the review is displayed on to have it removed.  Below we will cover good versus bad Reviews Management, best practices, and will close out with a guide to responding to Google reviews your business may already have.",

		text: "Reviews Management is processes of engaging with your customers by responding to reviews that they leave for your business on all review platforms such as Google, Angi, BBB, Yelp, TrustPilot, Facebook, and TripAdvisor. The objective isn’t to mindlessly respond to reviews though. A major part of the reviews management process is being able to keep track of all the different platforms your customers are leaving reviews on, and being able to see when new reviews are coming in on those platforms. Once you can track those reviews it’s important to keep an eye on what people are leaving reviews on and adapt if needed. Sometimes a review could be in reference to a specific employee, how clean something was, or the quality of service, metrics you as a business should want to monitor.",

This is for a few reasons, Google wants you to do it, it helps you stay in the know of what your customers are thinking, and gives you an opportunity to reply back to any negative comments ASAP." },
			{ head: "Personalize Your Responses", text: "What would you think of a business who had the exact same reply to each of their reviews? Would scam or fake reviews come to mind? I know it would for me. That’s why taking the time to type everything out manually and personalized is so important. It makes your business feel more human, and Google likes to see it too. Sometimes if you and your competitors both have a similar amount of reviews and ratings, how active you are replying to reviews could be a deciding factor to where you rank in things like Google Search. " },

			{ head: "Stay Professional When Responding to Negative Reviews", text: "As wrong as you may feel a customer is, never all yourself to reply to a negative review in a way that someone could possibly interpret as rude. The best thing to do is simply apologize and offer a solution. That said, if you have reason to believe that a review is fictitious you can take action to have that review removed by contacting the platform the review is displayed on." },

One of the great things about reviews is that it is a simple way for you to hear exactly what your customers like and dislike. A simple way to keep track of this is to use a notebook. As you read reviews, note down what customers are saying they like and dislike. Place a tally mark next to common likes and dislikes as you see them. Then review it weekly, see what your customers like and dislikes are, and take action where appropriate." },

With the help of QR codes you can make it super easy for a customer to scan and leave a review all in under 2 minutes. Take virtually no time out of their day, yet adds significant value to your business. Just like how YouTubers ask you to like and subscribe, you need to be asking customers to leave a review. But also use common sense. If you feel like something went wrong, or that the customer isn’t super happy with your service, we would recommend you skip the part where you ask them to leave a review." },

Meaning if you offer compensation in exchange for a review, the FTC may find out and arrest your or give you massive fine. So in addition to staying ethical, also be sure you keep a consistent routine when it comes to replying to reviews. This ones mostly for Google, they like to see you  actively engaging with your customers. " },
