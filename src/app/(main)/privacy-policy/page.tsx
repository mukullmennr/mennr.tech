                            We and our third-party partners collect information
                            about your use of our website through cookies.
                            Cookies are information files stored on your
                            computer, tablet or smartphone that help websites

                        <h3>What cookies are used on this Website</h3>
                        <p>
                            The cookies we and our business partners use on this
                            website are broadly grouped into the following
                            categories:
                        </p>
                        <h3>Essential</h3>
                        <p>
                            Some of the cookies on our website are essential for
                            us to be able to provide you with a service you have
                            requested. An example of this would be a cookie used
                            to enable you to log into your account on the
                            website or which allows communication between your
                            browser and the website.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Analytics</h3>
                        <p>
                            We use analytics cookies to help us understand how
                            users engage with our website. An example is
                            counting the number of different people coming to
                            our website or using a particular feature, rather
                            than the total number of times the site or feature
                            is used. Without this cookie, if you visited the
                            website once each week for three weeks we would
                            count you as three separate users. We would find it
                            difficult to analyze how well our website was
                            performing and improve it without these cookies.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We use cookies to improve your experience by
                            remembering your preferences so we know how you like
                            to use our website. Examples of this would be
                            remembering you so that you are served with the same
                            content, to remember you when you come back to the
                            site or to remember that you like logging in via
                            Facebook or other social media sites.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We use cookies to allow you to share content
                            directly on the social networking/sharing sites,
                            like Facebook, Twitter or Google+. Examples would be
                            if you wanted to “like” or “tweet” about a business
                            or product advertised on our website.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Interest-Based Advertising</h3>
                        <p>
                            You will have noticed that when you visit websites
                            you will be shown advertisements for products and
                            services you may wish to buy. Mennr, like many
                            businesses, places advertisements for itself and its
                            customers on a range of its partners websites.
                            However, to try and ensure that the advertisements
                            you see are relevant to you we use cookies to
                            collect information about the types of things that
                            interest you, for example websites you visit and the
                            geography that you are based in. Having these
                            cookies does not increase the number of
                            advertisements you will be shown, but simply makes
                            the advertisements you see more relevant.
